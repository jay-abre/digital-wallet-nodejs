# Digital Wallet Microservice Application

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of my internship at Stratpoint Technologies. The aim is to create a scalable, secure digital wallet application using a microservices architecture. The project emphasizes best practices in software development, including TypeScript, test-driven development (TDD), containerization, caching, monitoring, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

### Key Features
- **Scalable Architecture:** Utilizes microservices to ensure the application can scale horizontally.
- **Security:** Implements robust security measures to protect user data.
- **Performance:** Optimized for high performance with caching and efficient resource management.
- **Reliability:** Ensures high availability and reliability through comprehensive monitoring and automated tests.
